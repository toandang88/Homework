# Toan Dang

## My name is Toan Dang and I am an Infantryman stationing in FortHood Texas. I am on transitioning back to civilian life. I worked as a software engineer in test for 11 years before joining Army. I had experience in desktop application development but not web application. I quit coding for more than 5 years since joining the army. But my passion in coding is still there. That is why I join SavvyCoder to get my knowledge back and to be a real software developer.
## Here is my goal list for the course:
  * 1. Get used to work with Git and Github
  * 2. Understanding how back and front end communicate
  * 3. Develop my first real web application using Javascript and Node
  * 4. Get back to IT career as an web developer
